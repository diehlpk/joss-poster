# JOSS poster

Source files for a JOSS poster that I first presented at
[RSECon23](rsecon23.society-rse.org/).

Made using the [`tikzposter`](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikzposter) LaTeX
class.

`make` will download some images and compile the poster (basically
with `pdflatex joss-poster`).

You may need to install some LaTeX packages.
